## Breast mass segmentation in ultrasound (in construction) 

This site describes how to use the selective kernel U-Net (SK-U-Net) for breast mass segmentation in ultrasound imaging. We provide several examples that might be useful for other researchers interested in this topic. For details, please see our [BSPC paper](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control).

# Methods 

Architecture of the SK-U-Net is presented below:
